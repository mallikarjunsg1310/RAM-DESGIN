## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents the design and simulation of a Synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). RAM is an essential component of digital systems responsible for storing and retrieving data in processors, embedded systems, and communication devices.

The implemented RAM performs memory read and write operations based on clock and write enable control signals. All operations occur in synchronization with the clock, ensuring stable and reliable data transfer. The design is verified using simulation waveforms and synthesized using Cadence Genus to evaluate hardware performance such as power consumption, timing performance, and area utilization.

## 💻 Source Code

### 🔹 RAM Design (`syncram.v`)
Implements synchronous memory operations using clock, write enable, address, and data input signals. The design stores data in memory locations and retrieves stored data based on control signals.

### 🔹 Testbench (`syncram_tb.v`)
Applies different input combinations to verify RAM functionality and generates simulation waveforms.

Source files are available in the **Source_Code** folder.

## 🧠 RAM Operation

| Control Condition | Operation |
|---|---|
| Write Enable = 1 (Clock Edge) | Data is written into selected memory location |
| Write Enable = 0 (Clock Edge) | Stored data is read from memory |

Memory operations occur only at the positive edge of the clock signal.
